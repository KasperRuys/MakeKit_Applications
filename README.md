This is the beginning of  the android app and Progressive Web app to control the Battle:bit

For the android app, Android studio has been used but I believe it is possible to make use of MIT App Inventor to develop the app, which uses blockcode.
For the Progressive Web App I started development in Ionic. It has the code to scan for BLE devices but is unable to find any which is an issue I did not resolve. I have made use of the repo: https://loginov-rocks.github.io/Web-Bluetooth-Terminal/ 

For the Android application I did a lot of research and found Martin Woolley the most valuable to understanding how to communicate with a microbit.
